# Advent of Code - 2023

My goal is to do each exercise in a different language.

The language will be chosen randomly from this set (subject to changes): 
> C, C++, C#, D, Dart, Elixir, Go, <br>
> Haskell, Java(+), Javascript, Julia, Kotlin, Lua, OCaml, <br>
> Odin, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Typescript, Zig(+).

I'm accepting language suggestions (4 more and there will be no repetition).

### Languages
- Day 1 - Zig
- Day 2 - Java
